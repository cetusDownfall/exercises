Metro: A language for enabling musical notation in a simple, textual format.

Goals: 
	Allow for at least some of the expressiveness of a 
	traditional musical notation while allowing easy 
	typing and editing in a text editor.

Reqs:
	Tempo changes
	Volume changes
	Sharps/flats
	Key signatures (?)
	Octave changes
	Half notes, whole notes, quarter notes, triplets, etc.
	Looping patterns
	Simultaneous playing of multiple tracks.

Notation:
	Each "note" is represented by a letter and modifiers.
	asdfjkl are abcdefg in traditional musical notation.
	concert a or 440 hz is a.
	pitch modifiers: /\
		/ sharp
		\ flat
	articulation modifiers: ~-_`
		~ vibrato
		- sustain
	independent modifiers: ><][
		> lower volume
		< raise volume
		[ lower octave
		] raise octave
		_ dampen
		(tbd) ( start slur
		      ) end slur
	tempo modifiers: ,.
		, lower tempo
		. increase tempo
	a note can take a pitch and an articulation modifier, 
	and independent modifiers are to be used away from notes.
	Ex: a` would play a staccato concert a.

Organisation:
	A piece will begin at the start tag.
	Tags look like this - :example
	Tags should be on their own line.
	two special tags - :start and :end
	start starts the piece, end ends the piece.
	:start tag: can be used to begin playing the section beneath a tag.
	:end tag: is used to indicate the end of a section without ending others.
		^ where tag is any sequence of characters.
	{ } can be used to make anonymous sections.
	:tag: { } { } { } :end tag: can be used to play multiple things at once, or
	can be used inline:
		:start
			{a---}
			{d---}
			{k---}
		:end
	would play an a minor chord (i think?)
	note that independent modifiers are local to their section.
	tempos should not be
	tempos can be put after a start tag to play at a certain speed :start tag tempo
	Note that the tempo of the current section will be used if omitted.
	the first start tag defaults to 60 bpm.
