main considerations:
	Camera: how will it follow the player? I want this to be a fast paced sorta movement based game so this is CRITICAL.
	Physics/input delay: Must be intuitive. Must be //fast//.
	Jumping(as a subset of physics): This needs to be good as well. Adjustability?
	Acceleration/deceleration. did i spell that right.
	"stickiness"
	Should there be combat/enemies?
	Random generation? or predesigned levels?
	Terrain generation?
	Slope handling?
	tiles vs vectors.
	Center of mass.
	Aerial motion.
